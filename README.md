# Oversharing and Broad-sharing discovery
Discovery scripts useful in assessing oversharing, broadsharing, lifecycle before deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot.

**NOTE:** These scripts do not execute properly using Windows Power Shell ISE and require PowerShell Core or PowerShell Desktop to run.  

Unless otherwise noted, all scripts need to be run as ‚ÄòAdministrator‚Äô (local admin) from a PowerShell Core or PowerShell Desktop.

## Order of Operations
Execute these scripts in the order they are numbered and appear below.
